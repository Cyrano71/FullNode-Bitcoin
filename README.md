# BitCoin-BlockChain

Implementation of a BlockChain Minor Node, and a Complete Fake Client Wallet :
- Creation of Private and Public Key
- Creation Script
- Build a complete Transaction
- Synchronization of the different Node
- Proof of Work
- Verification and update of the BlockChain
- Create a maintainable and well organised code

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Node JS

### Installing

Copy the repository. Go to the repository in your computer. Then open 4 terminals screens. 

In the first screen type the following 

```
node Minor1.js
```

And repeat for the second screen 

```
node Minor2.js
```

And then for the third screen 

```
node Minor3.js
```

For the last one go to the folder WalletClient then  

```
node WalletClient1.js 1
node WalletClient1.js 2
node WalletClient1.js 3
node WalletClient1.js 4
```

Theses last command will send 4 transactions to the three Minor Node

## Integrity of BlockChain

To send a request to the Minor Node to retreive the BlockChain
and check it the BlockChain are the same in the 3 node do the following
when you are in the folder WalletClient

```
cd IntegrityBlockChain
node RequestBlockChain.js
```

The three node will write the BlockChain in the log file like
for example Log3005.txt
Then type :

```
sh diff.sh
```
