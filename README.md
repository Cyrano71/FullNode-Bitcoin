# BitCoin-BlockChain

## Shakespeare: Timon of Athens.

“Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens! 
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair, 
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant. 
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this 
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads: 
This yellow slave 
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed, 
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves 
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench: this is it 
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again; 
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores 
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices 
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
Thou common whore of mankind”

## MyWork

Implementation of a BlockChain Minor Node, and a Complete Fake Client Wallet :
- Creation of Private and Public Key
- Creation Script
- Build a complete Transaction
- Synchronization of the differents Nodes
- Proof of Work
- Verification and update of the BlockChain
- Manage the creatopn of a Fork BlockChain
- Create a maintainable and well organised code

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Node JS and Python version 3.0 or more

### Installing

Copy the repository. Go to the repository in your computer. Then type the following :

```
sh settle.sh
```

### Run the Application

Then open 4 terminals screens. 
In the first screen type the following 

```
node Minor1.js
```

And repeat for the second screen 

```
node Minor2.js
```

And then for the third screen 

```
node Minor3.js
```

For the last one go to the folder WalletClient then  

```
node WalletClient1.js 1
node WalletClient1.js 2
node WalletClient1.js 3
node WalletClient1.js 4
```

Theses last command will send 4 transactions to the three Minor Node

## Integrity of BlockChain

To send a request to the Minor Node to retreive the BlockChain
and check if the BlockChain are the same in the 3 node do the following
when you are in the folder WalletClient

```
cd IntegrityBlockChain
node RequestBlockChain.js
```

The three node will write the BlockChain in the log file like
for example Log3005.txt
Then type :

```
sh diff.sh
```
